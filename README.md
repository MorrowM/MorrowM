I'm a Mathematics student with an interest in functional programming!

- If I'm not doing coursework or studying for exams I'm probably cooking up some cursed Haskell code. (Did you know that you can have compile-time verified string literals with `OverloadedLabels` in GHC 9.6?) 

- I enjoy hanging out in the [functional programming Discord server](https://discord.gg/K6XHBSh). 

- I also have a [blog](http://www.morrowm.com/) that I don't update often enough.
